# PEP9_Translator
Hello and welcome to the PEP9 translator! The translator acts as a decompiler for 
Assembly Language programs (ASMB5) that decomposes said programs into a listing consisting of machine language programs (or Instruction Set Architecture Programs ISA3) and, if said programs are incorrect, proofread assembly language programs. Programs written according to PEP9 are written to adhere to syntax principles established by Pepperdine CS Program's Dr. Stan Warford.

# A How-To
To use the translator, simply input ASMB5 instructions (LDWA followed by hexadecimal constant 0x0000 (0's are empty placeholders), STWA followed by hexadecimal constant 0x0000 (0's are empty placeholders), and etc.)
and the translator will morph said instructions into 1 to 3 byte integer or character values 
into the machine language ISA3 language listing.
